Multi Version Concurrency Control is a method for concurrency control used in multiple database systems.

- It prevents users of a database system seeing inconsistent data when data is being written and read concurrently.
- It is an alternative to using read-write locks which are susecptible to contention issues, especially with long running transactions.
